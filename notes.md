# my notes

Tags and attributes are the basic atoms we compose

They are composed into componenets:

1. Static Components
2. Interactive Componenets

Static is simple, just displays static html to user

Interactive is complex, and has different types of interactive componenets

Special:

components are organized into a Single Page Application

SPAs are comprisd of:

1. A Nav Bar (Optional)
2. View(s) - more than one view would require a navbar

app bar model subclases component model and it the genreic for the component.

models should be composed with extras object where more fields can be defined.
